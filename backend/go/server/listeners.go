// Package main contains the logic for setting up and starting the Pub/Sub message listeners.
// These listeners are responsible for initiating backend processing workflows in response to events,
// such as new file uploads to Google Cloud Storage.
//
// Functions:
//   - SetupListeners: Initializes and starts the listeners for both high-resolution
//     and low-resolution media topics, attaching the corresponding processing workflows.
package main

// SetupListeners configures and starts the background Pub/Sub listeners.
// It creates the necessary media processing workflows and attaches them to the
// appropriate topic listeners.
//
// Inputs:
//   - config: The application's configuration, containing settings for storage, topics, etc.
//   - cloudClients: A struct containing all the initialized Google Cloud service clients.
//   - ctx: The application's root context, used to manage the lifecycle of the listeners.
//
// Outputs:
//   - This function does not return any value. It starts the listeners as background goroutines.
